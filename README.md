# Bitcoin-Blockchain

This project implements a simple Bitcoin Blockchain where you maintain a UTXO Pool and accept valid transactions to be included to the block and check for validity of the block and decide whether to be accepted in the blockchain or not.

There are test files that test scenarios of the implementation like SampleTxCases and SampleBlockchainCases that you can modify and add to to further test the program.
